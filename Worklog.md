I bought the grinder. It's an EK43, pre-2016 model with post-2015 Mahlkönig burrs. 
Definitely not perfectly aligned, which is something that I'll want to work on. It's mostly in
good shape. The face plate screws are a bit chewed up, and the paint job on the base has a few
scratches. I am planning on replacing the face plate screws, but the paint job will do for now.

The grinder came with the huge stock hopper, but that's definitely not something I'll be using.

I'll be using the grinder for both espresso and filter coffee.

According to the Internet, older EK43s didn't have the best manufacturing tolerances, which can
make aligning them difficult. In order to see what I'm working with, I've ordered some test
equipment. Depending on the manufacturing tolerances, I'll either be shimming the burrs or
sanding the grind chamber / burr carrier.

Ordered some items:

* Deflection gauge
* Feeler gauges
* Micrometer screw gauge
* Bellows
* Dosing cup

Still considering:

* Mahlkönig EK43 alignment tool (to radially align the stationary burr)
* New SSP burrs
* Titus burr carier (not sure if that even fits the pre-2016 EK43s)
